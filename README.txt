Hello Reader,

This is the README file for Alessandro DeChellis' capstone project completed for BrainStation's Data Science Bootcamp

The purpose of this report is to predict an NHL team's success based off of salary cap distribution between players
The analysis uses Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifiers for the predictions

The folder contains the following: 

- 4 Jupyter Notebookes
- 1 PDF Business report
- A data folder with 7 csv files
- this README file

In order to properly follow the code, the Jupyter Notebooks should be read in the following order:
Book1 - Data Collection
Book2 - Data Cleaning
Book3 - EDA and Visualization
Book4 - Modelling and Conclusions

Note: Do not run the code in Book1 or Book2, as there was much manual work done and they are to be used as guidlines
